The electric motor is a component that can generate mechanical motion when powered, and connecting the red wire terminal 1 to its cathode allows for the flow of current through the motor, which can activate it and potentially generate the necessary power to turn on the green light bulb. This connection is more direct and purposeful compared to connecting the anode in the component to the red wire terminal 1, which may not have a clear function or purpose in the circuit."}, {"[action]: connect red wire terminal 1 to cathode in electric motor; [observation]: terminal 1 on red wire is now connected to cathode on electric motor; In your inventory, you see:  an orange ; This room is called the workshop.

The expert has determined that the violet light bulb is the key component that needs to be activated in order to power on the green light bulb. By connecting the cathode in the violet light bulb to the anode in the component, the expert is creating a circuit that will allow the flow of electricity to reach the violet light bulb and activate it. This activation will then trigger the green light bulb to turn on. The expert has determined that this sequence of connections is the most effective way to achieve the desired"}]}
