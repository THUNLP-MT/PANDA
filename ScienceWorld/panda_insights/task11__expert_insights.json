By moving flower pot 2 to flower pot 1, the water in flower pot 2 will be transferred to flower pot 1, providing the necessary moisture for the seed to germinate and grow. This ensures that the cherry seed is placed in an environment that is already suitable for its growth, increasing the chances of successful germination and development."}]}
